Are there little beaded presents attached to them? These aren&#39;t regular cards!\r\nA:We pride ourselves in not giving regular cards. If we can help it, we&#39;ll even change how you say &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; (to something like &#39;Make A Wish)&#39;. Kat n&#39; Drew Cards is about change and giving more than a gift. All of our items come with some attached gift to create a gift all in one card. You can give it as a small gift in itself or attach it as a compliment to larger gift items. It is about the freedom of gift giving, to find something you know your person will love.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you offer wholesale pricing or quantity discounts?\r\nA: We do have wholesale pricing available for many of our items and many of them can be made in quantity. Just ask us about viewing this pricing. \r\n\r\nQuantity discounts are available and usually work just to take the price down that little bit.
